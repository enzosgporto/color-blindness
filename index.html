                    <p>
                        Colour blindness is when a person has problems distinguishing between certain colours, caused by the pigments in the cones in your eyes
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For us to understand how colour blindness works, we first need to understand how your eyes see colours. Your eyes have two types of cell that detect light. You have rods which only detect light and dark. And then you have cones. The way colour works is through wavelengths, reddish colours have a long wavelength, bluish colours have a shorter one. The cones in your eyes are what can detect those colours and wavelengths. There are three types of cones that perceive colour: red, green and blue. According to the wavelength of a colour, a certain amount of cones will be stimulated.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Colour Blindness happens when there is a problem in the pigment of your cones, these pigments are called photopigments. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Colour blindness can be genetic, and inherited genes from your parents can cause faulty photopigment. But damage to the optic nerve, physical or chemical damage to the eye can also cause colour blindness, damage to the parts of the brain that process colour information and cataracts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are three different categories of colour blindness, each of them with their own individual types.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First, there is red-green colour blindness, which is when the photopigments in the red cones and green cones don't work well. This can cause 4 different types of colour blindness: 
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Deutaranomaly, which is the most common form of colour blindness and happens when the green cone photopigment doesn't work properly. This causes a person to perceive yellow and green as redder, and makes it hard to tell blue from violent
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Protanomaly, which is when your red cone photopigment doesn't work properly, which causes a person to perceive orange, red and yellow much greener, and also make colours seem less bright. It usually doesn't cause problems in daily life
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Protanotapia, which is when your red cone photopigment doesn't work, which causes a person to perceive a red colour as dark grey. Some shades of orange, yellow and green look yellow
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Deuteranopia, which is when your green cone photopigment doesn't work, which causes a person to perceive red as brownish-yellow, and greens to be perceived as beige
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Then, there is blue-yellow colour blindness, which is when the photopigments in your blue cone don't work properly. This is the second most common category and can cause two different types of colour blindness:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Tritanomaly, which is when your blue cone photopigments only work in a limited way, which causes a person to perceive blue as greener, and it can be hard to tell pink from yellow and red. It's extremely rare
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Trinatopia, which is when you have no blue cone photopigments, and it causes a person to perceive blue as green, and yellow as light gray or violet. Similar to Tritanomaly, it's extremely rare
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Complete colour blindness, which is also known as monochromacy and is when a person can't perceive any colours at all. There are two types
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cone Monochromacy, which is when 2 of your 3 cone photopigments don't work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rod monochronacy, which is also known as achromatopsia, which is the most severe type of colour blindness, and it’s when none of your cone cells have photopigments that work. This makes it so that everything in the person’s surrounding is perceived as white, black and grey. It also causes uncontrollable eye movement (nystagmus) and bright light may hurt your eyes
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Hear from Samuel Rocha, a student of Newton College, as he shares his own experiences with color blidness, how it has affected his learning experience, and most importantly, his advice for those who are not familiar with the condition
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Samuel is a student from Form IV. He was born in Lima and has always attended Newton College, alongside his two older sisters who have already graduated. He was diagnosed with Color Blindness at a young age and has lived with the condition in silent since.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        By listening to him, I hope you get a scope into the lives of people with this condition, and that it pushes you to find out more about it.

                  <h3 id="help"><strong>How can you help? A guide for teachers</strong></h3>
                  <p>
                    As a teacher, it can often be disorienting to know exactly what to do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most important thing, however, is respect. Do not victimize your students with colour blindness, make sure they feel as if they are in an environment that welcomes them for the condition they have, and is willing to adapt to their needs. There is a difference between inclusion and separation, the line if often thin, and it's always important to be mindful of whether you are crossing it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But what can you actually do? Well, there are simple things you can add to your classroom to help students with colour blindness
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Adjust Lighting:</strong> Light is crucial when it comes to colour recognition. The brighter the environment, the easier it is to recognize colours. Therefore, try to seat colour-blind students in a place that has plenty of natural light. Avoid coloured lights, such as yellowed lights
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Lend a Helping Hand:</strong> Whenever it is necessary for you to use colours, assign a classmate (who should be a friend or someone of trust for the colour blindness student) or offer yourself to help them
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Picky With Resources:</strong>  Whenever there are worksheets or textbook pages that are too difficult to read, photocopy them into black and white and add text indicators to replace colour labels. However, if doing so, do it for the whole class. Again, the idea is inclusion, not separation.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Pick Whiteboard Markers Carefully </strong> Stick to black markers. And if it is absolutely necessary for you to use colours, stick to colours that are bold and provide contrast
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Label Everything: </strong> Whenever you have items in your classroom that are heavily colour reliant (such as behaviour charts), label colour sections accordingly.

                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Make sure art supplies and coloured supplies are labelled: </strong> Similar to the previous points on materials, finding colour supplies and simply colour supplies in general can be challenging for students with colour blindness. Label them to make it easy to read. It is also a good idea to refer to certain elements, such as “yellow sun”, “green frog”, etc. Remember to avoid condescending references
